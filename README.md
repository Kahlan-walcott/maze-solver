# Maze Solver

You need to be familiar with Python.

Description:

This maze solver recursively finds each path in a maze. The maze is given to the function as the path (o's) and walls (x's) along with the starting and ending positions. It will also find the shortest path in the maze when the function is called.

To interact with this you can type *py, python,* or *python3 maze.py* and it will display all of the shortest paths it found.

If you want to change what you are seeing you have to download the code.
